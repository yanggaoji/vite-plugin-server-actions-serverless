# TODO

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Ensure user defined middleware is bundled into production server build

### Configuration Enhancements

- [ ] Add configurable output server filename (default to server.js)
- [ ] Add ability to disable openapi.json and swagger-ui separately
- [ ] Allow configuring the output filename/location for openapi.json and swagger-ui when building
- [ ] Allow silencing the logging

### Additional Examples

- [x] Add Vue.js example todo app (exact replica of Svelte functionality)
- [x] Add React example todo app (exact replica of Svelte functionality)
- [ ] Add Riot.js example todo app (exact replica of Svelte functionality)
- [ ] Add Alpine.js example todo app (exact replica of Svelte functionality)

### Features

- [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time server actions (alternative transport mechanism instead of HTTP fetch calls
      from the client-side)
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware example
- [ ] Add "drop-in" simple authentication middleware that uses cookies/sessions and json/sqlite for storing user
      accounts and authenticated session (not really meant for prod usage, but it could i guess)
- [ ] Add support for streaming responses

## Future Improvements

### Security Enhancements (High Priority)

- [ ] Add request timeout middleware with configurable timeouts per action
- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware with memory store for dev and Redis example for production
- [ ] Add request body size limits and file upload size restrictions
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection with token generation/validation
- [ ] Add security headers middleware (helmet.js integration)
- [ ] Implement API key/token authentication options
- [ ] Add file type validation and virus scanning hooks for uploads

### Production Readiness (High Priority)

- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT) with connection draining
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints (/health, /ready) with custom checks
- [ ] Add request ID tracking for debugging and correlation
- [ ] Include structured logging for production environments
- [ ] Add clustering support for multi-core utilization
- [ ] Implement proper error tracking with configurable error reporting
- [ ] Add monitoring/APM integration hooks (OpenTelemetry, etc.)
- [ ] Create deployment guides for common platforms (Docker, K8s, serverless)

### Performance Optimizations (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Add response compression (gzip/brotli) to production builds
- [ ] Implement AST parsing cache with LRU eviction
- [ ] Add proper memory management for TypeScript module cache
- [ ] Implement request deduplication for identical concurrent requests
- [ ] Add connection pooling examples for database operations
- [ ] Implement response caching layer with invalidation strategies
- [ ] Add request queuing for rate-limited operations

### Code Organization (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Split large index.js file (~900 lines) into smaller modules
- [ ] Extract TypeScript handling to separate module
- [ ] Reorganize middleware into dedicated directory structure
- [ ] Create separate build utilities module
- [ ] Implement plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] Add middleware composition utilities

### Developer Experience Enhancements

- [ ] Add authentication middleware examples (JWT/session-based)
- [ ] Implement WebSocket transport for real-time server actions
- [ ] Add request/response interceptor support
- [ ] Create batch operations support for multiple actions
- [ ] Add GraphQL-like field selection to reduce payload size
- [ ] Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add playground UI for interactive API exploration
- [ ] Create migration guide from traditional API routes
- [ ] Add SSR framework support (Next.js, Nuxt.js)
- [ ] Implement HMR for schema changes
- [ ] Add TypeScript declaration maps for better IDE support
