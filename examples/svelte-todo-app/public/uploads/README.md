# Upload Directory

This directory contains uploaded files from the todo app. In a production environment, these would typically be stored in a cloud storage service like S3, but for this example they're stored locally.

Example files referenced in todos.json:
- financial-report-q4.pdf
- mobile-bug-screenshot.png
- architecture-proposal.pdf
